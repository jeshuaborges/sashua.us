    <h2>By Air</h2>
    We are darn near paradise and close to an airport too! The San Luis Obispo Regional Airport is a 30-45 minute car
    ride away. Uber and Lyft are readily available but not cheap. You should expect to pay about $80-90 dollars for a
    ride to Paso.

    We also recommend airports in Santa Barbara (2 hours to the south) and San Jose (2.5 hours to the north, pending
    traffic conditions). LAX and SFO are fine too - they are both 3.5 hours away.

    <h2>By Bus & Train</h2>

    We applaud you for braving public transportation in California! The Paso Robles Station serves Greyhound busses and
    Amtrak trains. It is just a few blocks from downtown.

    <h2>By Car</h2>
